# Tcl Bug: Unexpected Behavior with Variable Type Handling

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Tcl related to how variables are handled, particularly when comparing or performing arithmetic operations on variables that might unexpectedly hold strings instead of numbers.

The `bug.tcl` file contains a procedure that illustrates this issue.

The `bugSolution.tcl` file provides a corrected version, showcasing best practices for handling potential type mismatches.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Run `bug.tcl` using a Tcl interpreter.
3. Observe the unexpected output.

## Understanding the Problem

Tcl's dynamic typing can be a source of confusion.  The comparison in the original procedure assumes both `$a` and `$b` are always numeric. If they are strings (e.g. due to user input or data source), the comparison will work on string values, leading to incorrect results. 

## Solution

The solution emphasizes type checking or explicitly converting variables to numbers before performing numerical operations or comparisons.  Robust error handling is also advisable.
